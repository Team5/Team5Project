UCC was established in 1845 as one of three Queen's Colleges at Cork, Galway and Belfast.  The site chosen for the college is particularly appropriate given its connection with the patron saint of Cork, St Finbarr.  It is believed his monastery and school stood on the bank of the river Lee, which runs through the lower grounds of the university.  The University's motto is  'Where Finbarr Taught, let Munster Learn.'

University College, Cork is now one of four constituent universities of the federal National University of Ireland.  The Universities Act 1997, came into operation in June 1997 and provides for the transfer of powers and functions from the National University of Ireland to its constituent universities (eg staff appointments, programme approval and the conduct of examinations), for internal reorganisation of universities (eg governing authorities) and for some changes in relationships between universities and the state (eg, role of the Higher Education Authority).

The University had been subject to other legislation over the years, The University Education (Ireland) Act, 1879, and the Irish Universities Act 1908 which affected the name of the university and the matriculation processes.

UCC was chosen by The Sunday Times as the Irish University of the year for 2003, and again for 2005.  This Award was given  for a number of reasons- the University's position as the leading research institution in Ireland; its cosmopolitan character with an admirable student mix; the excellence of its teaching and academic standards; the flexibility of its degree programmes; its low drop-out rates; its high level of graduate employment; its links with business and industry and its successful Access and Bridging the Gap programmes.

Further information on UCC's history is available in Professor John A Murphy's three books on the University: The College: A History of Queen's/ University College Cork, 1845-1995 ;  Where Finbarr Taught:  A concise History of Queen's/ University College Cork and University College Cork: A portrait in Words and Images.  The books are available in UCC's Boole Library or in the Visitors' Centre visitorscentre@ucc.ie.  The University's Office of Media and Communications has produced a compact   Guide to University College Cork  for the general public and A Schools' Guide to UCC, both available from the Visitors' Centre.
